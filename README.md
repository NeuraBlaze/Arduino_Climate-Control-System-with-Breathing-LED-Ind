The code effectively handles input from the DHT11 sensor and processes this data to control the fan and LEDs. 


Code Capabilities:

The code effectively handles input from the DHT11 sensor and processes this data to control the fan and LEDs.
Uses digitalWrite() and analogWrite() for LED control, with PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for the green LED to create a breathing light effect.
Implements non-blocking delay techniques using millis() to ensure that the sensor readings and LED updates do not halt the system's responsiveness.
Potential Developments:

Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Connectivity: Adding wireless connectivity could enable remote monitoring and control through a smartphone app or web interface.
Data Logging: Integrate an SD card module or connectivity to a cloud database for logging temperature and humidity over time, which would be valuable for trend analysis and historical data review.
Enhanced User Interaction: Incorporate touch screen controls or more sophisticated user input options for setting temperature and humidity thresholds manually.
Integration with Smart Home Systems: Enable compatibility with IoT platforms like Google Home or Amazon Alexa for voice-controlled operation and better integration into smart home ecosystems.
Energy Efficiency Improvements: Implement more complex algorithms for fan and heating control to optimize energy usage based on predictive models of environmental changes.
This project serves as a functional prototype for a home or office climate control system, with ample opportunities for further enhancements to increase its utility and integration into larger systems.
